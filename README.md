# Getting Started

To deploy to AWS, you must have an AWS account and credentials file. You should also install serverless globally. To deploy, run:
```
npm i
serverless deploy
```

You must deploy to AWS before running locally so that all resources will be created. To run the API locally using serverless-offline:
```
npm run start
```
